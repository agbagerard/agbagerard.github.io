Hey there, curious minds! 👋 I'm a self-taught developer diving headfirst into the fascinating worlds of AI and machine learning (basically, anything that makes computers think!). Currently, I'm cooking up a meal planner app – stay tuned for the delicious details! 🚀

Beyond the code, I'm a bit of an adventurer at heart. 🌍 Originally hailing from the French-speaking land of Togo in West Africa, I'm always up for exploring new horizons, both digital and real.

On this blog, you'll find a fun mix of my passions: from coding adventures and the latest tech that sparks my interest, to the captivating anime I'm watching and the thought-provoking books I'm currently lost in. Consider this my little corner of the internet where I share the things that make me tick. Let's learn and explore together! 😄
